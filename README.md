# OneStop Web Apps

Nx monorepo for the OneStop Cinolu web applications. The workspace currently contains two server-rendered Angular apps:

- `client`: public-facing OneStop site with pages for landing, programs, projects, opportunities, events, blog, ambassadors, partners, FAQ, auth, and user dashboard flows.
- `admin`: internal admin portal for managing dashboard, users, ventures, programs, projects, opportunities, events, mentors, blog, and account flows.

## Tech Stack

- Nx `22`
- Angular `21`
- Angular SSR with Express server output
- Tailwind CSS `4`
- ESLint and Prettier
- NgRx Signals
- ngx-translate
- Quill, FilePond, Notyf, and lucide-angular for editor, upload, notification, and icon UI pieces

## Requirements

- Node.js compatible with Angular `21`
- pnpm

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Development

Run the public client app:

```sh
pnpm dev:client
```

Run the admin app:

```sh
pnpm dev:admin
```

The admin dev server is configured on port `4000`. The client app uses the Angular dev server default unless overridden from the command line.

You can also call Nx targets directly:

```sh
pnpm nx serve client
pnpm nx serve admin
```

## Build

Build each app for production:

```sh
pnpm build:client
pnpm build:admin
```

Build outputs are written to:

- `dist/apps/client`
- `dist/apps/admin`

Both apps use Angular's server output mode. After building, run the SSR server entry with:

```sh
pnpm ssr:client
pnpm ssr:admin
```

## Quality Checks

Run lint for a project:

```sh
pnpm nx lint client
pnpm nx lint admin
```

Inspect all available targets for a project:

```sh
pnpm nx show project client
pnpm nx show project admin
```

View the Nx project graph:

```sh
pnpm nx graph
```

## Nx Notes

This workspace uses project-level `project.json` files under `apps/client` and `apps/admin`. Shared Nx defaults live in `nx.json`, including Angular build caching and ESLint target configuration.

New Angular applications and libraries should follow the generator defaults in `nx.json`: CSS styles, ESLint enabled, and no generated test runner unless explicitly added.
